		<h2>Graphic novels and Mangas</h2>
		<p>The graphic novels and novellas are comics that further expand on the world of 'Warriors', and tells different stories as opposed to what we see in the main books. Most of the mangas are split up into three parts, which can be brought either seperately or all together. Otherwise, they are just standalone stories.</p>
		<li>'Graystripe's Adventure' ('The Lost Warrior', 'Warrior's Refuge' and 'Warrior's Return') (2007)</li>
		<li>'Tigerstar and Sasha': 'Into the Woods', 'Escape from the Forest' and 'Return to the Clans' (2008)</li>
		<li>'Ravenpaw's Path': 'Shattered Peace', 'A Clan in Need' and 'The Heart of a Warrior' (2009)</li>
		<li>'SkyClan and the Stranger': 'The Rescue', 'Beyond the Code' and 'After the Flood' (2011)</li>
		<li>'The Rise of Scourge' (2008)</li>
		<p>The graphic novels are different to the mangas, as they are standalone stories that aren't split up into three different parts. There are currently four available graphic novels.</p>
		<li>'A Shadow in RiverClan (2020)'</li>
		<li>'Winds of Change' (2021)</li>
		<li>'Exile from ShadowClan' (2022)</li>
		<li>'A Thief in ThunderClan' (2023)</li>
		<p>There will also be a graphic novel adaptation of all six books in 'The Prophecies Begin'. These books are not out yet, though it is set to release in 2024.</p>
