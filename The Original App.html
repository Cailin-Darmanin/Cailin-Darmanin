		<h1>The Original Warrior Cats App</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>The original 'Warriors' app was an app that was released in June of 2011, and it was available for iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, and Android. This app featured many things, such as character trivia, book checklists, and quiz games. The app has since been taken off the app store, and cannot be accessed on newer devices due to lack of updates. However, people who had downloaded the app prior are still able to access the app without issue.</p>

		<h2>The Checklist</h2>
	    <p>The checklist section of the app is very simple, as it allows you to keep track of which books you have. This checklist, in recent days however, is incredicly outdated, as it only contains main series books up to 'Sign of the Moon', which is the fifth book of 'Omen of the Stars'.</p>

	<article class="item">
		<h2>Cats of the Clans</h2>
		<p>This section of the app has the most to learn about, as it contains all sorts of information about the Clans, some of the cats, the warrior code, etc.</p>
		<p>'The Cats': allowed for the viewer to read about some of the more prominent characters in the series (Firestar, Tigerstar, etc.). Some of these pages introduced some interesting facts about certain characters, like the identity of Firestar's mother and Blackstar being a polydactyl cat. These pages were limited, however, and some characters were confined to sharing one page amongst each other (Hollyleaf, Lionblaze and Jayfeather, for example).</p>
		<p>'The Clans': talked about the different clans (Thunder, River, Shadow, Wind, Sky and Star) and also contained information about the hierarchy of the clans (leaders, deputies, medicine cats, warriors, etc.). Small bits of trivia could be found in each individual clan.</p>
		<p>'The Warrior Code': showed a list with each rule that makes up the warrior code. Not much else was present in this section.</p>
		<p>'Maps': featured a map of both the forest territories and lake territories, as well as documenting the locations of where certain battles took place (for example, the battle against BloodClan in 'The Darkest Hour'). Both the forest and lake territories have information about the different parts of each clan's territory, such as the Snakerocks in ThunderClan territory.</p>
		<p>'Glossary': contained a list of terms and phrases that are used in the books (for example, 'kittypet' means a pet cat and 'twoleg' means human). There was not much else to this section.</p>

		<h2>Timeline</h2>
		<p>Another section of this app was the official Timeline, which revealed when certain things happened and when certain books took place (for example, books like 'Yellowfang's Secret' and 'Tallstar's Revenge' take place before 'Into The Wild'). This section was unfortuately incredibly flawed, and was incredibly outdated once more and more books were written and published.</p>
	</article>
			
	<article class="item">
		<h2>Read the books</h2>
		<p>This section allowed for the viewer to read the first five chapters of the first book; 'Into The Wild'. However, full books were never published, and the viewer would have to instead buy the book on their own, either physically or digitally</p>
	</article>
			
	<article class="item">
		<h2>Exclusives</h2>		
		<p>This section has the least amount of content within it, as it only contains some short stories and a single video (which has since been set to private on YouTube)</p>
	</article>	
		
	<article class="item">
		<h2>Trivia Game</h2>
		<p>The trivia section of the app conists of a quiz game that tests your knowledge of the books and characters. This trivia game would be split up into three different parts that you could choose from; one simply titled 'Warriors' (before it was renamed to 'The Prophecies Begin'), another titled 'The New Prophecy', and the third titled 'Power Of Three', all of which contained questions about the respective arcs.</p>
		<p>When playing the trivia game, you are given a question with a set of multiple choice answers depending on which arc you decide to quiz yourself on. You are also given one minute to answer as many correct questions as you can.</p>
		<p>however, a few people over the course of the app's run have pointed out flaws in the trivia game, as there have been answers listed that are not actually correct. For example, one person pointed out that Spottedleaf's killer was mistakenly listed as Barley instead of the cat who actually killed her, that cat being the ShadowClan warrior Clawface.</p>
