		<h2>Character Trivia</h2>
		<p>'Warriors' is a series that has spanned many books over many years. Due to this, there are many characters, each with unique facts about them that can be either scattered throughout the books, or revealed by one of the series' many authors.</p>
		<li>Tigerstar (Tigerclaw at the beginning of the series) was originally given the name Hammerclaw. This was obviously changed, as cats do not know what hammers are. Instead, the name Tigerclaw was given.</li>
		<li>While there is no official cause of death for the kittypet, Jake, Victoria Holmes stated on her Facebook that Jake was struck by a meteor while sitting on a fence. This was confirmed to be a joke, however.</li>
		<li>Hollyleaf was originally supposed to be one of the prophecy cats. She was later replaced by Dovewing, as Vicky could not think of a power that would suit her character.</li>
		<li>The RiverClan elder known as Heavystep has died twice of the same cause (greencough), though he has been listed in alliegences that take place after both deaths.</li>
		<li>Ferncloud's death was said by Vicky to be a result of the fans' dislike of her character. She was placed into the battle under the belief that she could fight like any warrior, and she died defending the nursery.</li>
		<li>Sunstar, the ThunderClan leader before Bluestar, only recieved eight lives from StarClan when he became leader. This is because Pinestar kept his ninth life when he left to become a kittypet</li>
		<li>Ivypool's name is taken from the name of a daughter of one of Vicky's friends, Ivy Poole</li>

		<h2>Book Trivia</h2>
		<li>As stated before, 'Rising Storm' was given two different covers by Wayne, the hardcover featuring Cloudkit while the paperback featured Sandstorm.</li>
		<li>Originally, in 'The Darkest Hour', Tigerstar was going to be the cat that Firestar would have to fight in the end. However, after a suggestion by a collegue that Tigerstar should be killed by another cat, the decision was made that a twist villain (Scourge) would replace him.</li>
		<li>'The New Prophecy' was suppossed to be a trilogy (three books). Harper Collins insisted that the series be extended to six books, like the series that came before.</li>
		<li>'Sunrise' originally had the title 'Cruel Season', though Harper Collins had the name changed due to it being too dark.</li>
		<li>The fourth arc 'Omen of the Stars', was originally called 'The Fourth Apprentice', though this was later given to the first book of the arc.</li>
		<li>'The New Prophecy' also went through a name change, as it was supposed to be called 'The Next Generation', as a nod to 'Star Trek: The Next Generation'.</li>
		<li>The prophecy presented in 'The Apprentice's Quest'("embrace what you find in the shadows, for only they can clear the sky") was phrased differently before ("only the cat who finds what is lost can prosper")</li>
		<li>The working title for 'Thunder and Shadow' was 'The Lost Clan'.</li>
		<li>Similar to the last fact, the original title for the book 'Squirrelflight's Hope' was 'Squirrelflight's Kin'.</li>
		<li>like the last two facts, 'Leopardstar's Honour' had the working title 'Leopardstar's Salvation'.</li>
		<li>Due to the length of 'Bluestar's Prophecy', the russian translation was of the book was split into two parts.</li>
		<li>The book cover for 'Onestar's Confession' had two possible varients: blue and red. Fans were given the chance to vote on which cover would be the official one, and the blue cover won in the end. The cover varients can be seen <a href="https://img.warriorcats.com/29cd818c-3645-4dff-9da8-c5762e3d47cb.jpeg" target="new">here</a></li>
		<li>'Riverstar's Home' was the result of a poll that was made to decide who'd be getting a super edition in 2023 (the contenders being Riverstar, Ivypool and Mistystar). This poll gained a lot of controversy, as the votes were skewed to favour Riverstar, who ended up being the winner.</li>
		<li>There is a major inconsistancy between 'The Prophecies Begin' and 'Redtail's Debt', as despite Oakheart being killed in a rockslide in the original series, Redtail is said to have killed Oakheart himself in his novella.</li>
		<li>'The Rise of Scourge' tells the story of Scourge, and how he became the founder and leader of BloodClan. This story was said to mirror Firestar's story, only with a much darker path for Scourge to follow in the end.</li>
